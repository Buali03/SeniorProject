## 🔍 Key Findings

The study surveyed 161 participants in Bahrain and found:

- **Social Influence** emerged as the strongest predictor (β = 0.247) of cashless payment adoption
- Five key factors significantly predict usage: self-efficacy, trust, social influence, perceived benefit, and ease of use
- 57.1% of participants do not carry cash regularly
- The regression model achieved exceptional fit (R² = 0.990), explaining 99% of variance in cashless payment usage
- Despite awareness of security concerns, these did not significantly deter adoption among the primarily young, educated sample
