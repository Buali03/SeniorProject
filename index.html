            Exploring Digital Payment Adoption and Public Readiness

              This study is dedicated to a closer look at the evolution towards
              a cashless society or the one with less cash in it within the
              Kingdom of Bahrain, whereby citizens' and residents' willingness
              to adopt digital payment systems is the point in question. The
              research is based on three main factors, which are convenience,
              security, and speed, and on the other side, but equally important,
              the issue of privacy implications, digital divide, and
              technological restrictions were also studied. The study was
              conducted through a structured questionnaire delivered to be
              different categories of the population across Bahrain. The main
              goal of the research is to measure the intensity of public
              subjection, pinpoint obstacles to the diffusion, and provide
              possible suggestions on how to enable a secure as well as
              inclusive electronic finance. This research directly supports the
              national goal of Bahrain by the establishment of digital financial
              transformation and the encouragement of financial innovation.

                  This project looks at how Bahrain is moving toward a cashless
                  or less-cash society by focusing on how willing people are to
                  use digital payments. It examines three main positives:
                  convenience, security, and speed. But also considering worries
                  such as privacy, the digital device, and technology limits.
                  The study aims to measure willingness to adopt, find the main
                  issues, and suggests ways to make digital payments more secure
                  and inclusive.

                  The survey included 161 participants; about 84% were aged

                  had the strongest effect on intention to use cashless payments
                  (β = .247), followed by computer self-efficacy, ease of use,
                  trust, and perceived benefit (all significant at p < 0.05).

                  This study shows that young, educated people in Bahrain are
                  the main users of cashless payments, influenced by social
                  circles, trust, ease of use, and computer skills. Older and
                  less educated groups were not well represented, so their views
                  are still unknown. Future work should focus on these groups
                  and test ways to reduce barriers to using cashless payments.

              <p>
                In recent years, many countries are transitioning from cash to
                digital payments. Bahrain is experiencing increased adoption of
                online payments, mobile wallets, and banking apps. However,
                moving completely away from cash presents challenges related to
                privacy, security, and digital accessibility concerns.

              <br />
              <p>
                This project examines the readiness and willingness of Bahrain's
                population to adopt digital payment and cashless systems and
                reduce reliance on cash. While cashless payment systems are
                increasingly being implemented and studied globally, limited
                research exists on public perception and adoption readiness in
                Bahrain. A 2023 Statista report indicates that approximately 32%
                of people in the Middle East and North Africa still rely heavily
                on cash, suggesting that traditional payment methods remain
                prevalent.

          <div class="implications-container">
            <p>
              This study shows that young, educated people in Bahrain are the
              main users of cashless payments, influenced by social circles,
              trust, ease of use, and computer skills. However, older and less
              educated groups were not well represented, so their views are
              still unknown. The research provides strong evidence supporting
              Bahrain's digital transformation goals while highlighting areas
              needing attention for inclusive adoption.

            This research acknowledges several limitations that should guide

          <div class="limitations-grid">
            <div class="limitation-card">
              <strong>Sample Bias:</strong> The sample heavily skewed toward
              young adults (18-24) and students, limiting generalizability to
              the broader Bahraini population
            </div>
            <div class="limitation-card">
              <strong>Cross-Sectional Design:</strong> The study captured

              and temporal pattern analysis

          <h2>Path Forward</h2>
          <div class="path-forward-container">
            <p>
              Future work should test ways to reduce barriers to using cashless
              payments across all demographic segments. Success in achieving a
              transition cashless society in Bahrain depends on inclusive
              strategies that address the needs, concerns, and capabilities of
              diverse population groups. Continued research, policy development,
              and technological innovation must work in concert to realize the
              vision of a secure, efficient, and equitable digital financial
              ecosystem that benefits all members of Bahraini society.
